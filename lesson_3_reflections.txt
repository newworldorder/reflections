Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

When it's possible that your machine may be compromised or corrupted, or when you're
collaborating with someone else, or when you want to make it easy for others to collaborate
with you. 


Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Some pushes may break dependencies of a project you're working on. Separately, you
may be working something that is designed to work for a previous previous version
of the commit history.
