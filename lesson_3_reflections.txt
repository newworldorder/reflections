Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

When it's possible that your machine may be compromised or corrupted, or when you're
collaborating with someone else, or when you want to make it easy for others to collaborate
with you. 


Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Some pushes may break dependencies of a project you're working on. Separately, you
may be working something that is designed to work for a previous previous version
of the commit history. 

Question: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

Forks are git clones that happen on GitHub servers.  Clones copy a git repo from one
location to another. Branches correspond to the head of a commit history.  You would
use forks when you wanted to patch/modify an existing project on GitHub and eventually
make a pull request to the original repository. Branches are done when you want to
experiment with some new direction of a given codebase and you know that others will
be making updates to the master or the master is branch is expected to not have these
kind of experiments occurring. 

Question: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It enables that local copy to serve as a server for other clients.  If the server
were to ever become damaged, then there would still be a way to restore the repo.
